        Hiya, welcome to the page. I'm not really sure what to put here, but thanks for visiting!
        <br><br>
        In the future I may add a nice swish menu, some sort of background, maybe even a <abbr title="My speciality :3">puzzle</abbr>. Watch this space.

        Below are a few hyperlinks, to various projects of mine. Don't expect anything top notch, because... well, I'm not top notch. Closer to medium if anything. So, expect medium notch.

      <h2>Page -> GitHub Bookmark</h2>
      
      <p>
        If you want a way to snoop around the GitHub repositories for each page, use my custom bookmark code (create a new bookmark and set the URL to be the following):
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-size: 12px;"><code>javascript:var username = location.hostname.split(".github.io").join(""); var path = location.pathname.slice(1); var slashIndex = path.indexOf("/"); if (slashIndex != -1) {path = path.slice(0,slashIndex)}; (function(){window.location.assign(location.protocol+'//'+'github.com:'+location.port+'/'+username+'/'+path)})();</code></span>
        <br>
        <button id="copybmcode" onclick="copybmcode()">Copy</button>
        <br><br>
        To use it, go to a GitHub Pages page and click the bookmark while on it - this should redirect you to the repository.
